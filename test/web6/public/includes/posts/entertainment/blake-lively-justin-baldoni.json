  "content": "A judge on Monday dismissed Justin Baldoni’s $400 million defamation lawsuit against Hollywood power couple Blake Lively and Ryan Reynolds, a major development in the ongoing civil litigation between former co-stars Lively and Baldoni.\n\nIn January, Baldoni sued Lively and her husband Ryan Reynolds, alleging that the Hollywood couple sought to “destroy” him and his career, after hijacking his film, “It Ends With Us.” Baldoni’s complaint escalated the ongoing legal battle stemming from the film that Baldoni directed and co-starred in with Lively.\n\nIn a statement, Lively’s lawyers Esra Hudson and Mike Gottlieb called the ruling “a total victory and a complete vindication.”\n\n“As we have said from day one, this ‘$400 million’ lawsuit was a sham, and the Court saw right through it,” the statement added.\n\nIn December 2024, Lively filed a civil rights complaint, claiming that she was sexually harassed by Baldoni during production of the film and then was retaliated against for speaking up about her alleged mistreatment. Baldoni immediately denied Lively’s claims.\n\nLively eventually escalated her civil rights complaint, officially filing a lawsuit against Baldoni.\n\nIn a statement posted on her Instagram Story, Lively wrote that she was grateful for the support she’s received and said she is committed to continue advocating for women.\n\n“Like so many others, I’ve felt the pain of a retaliatory lawsuit, including the manufactured shame that tries to break us. While the suit against me was defeated, so many don’t have the resources to fight back,” she wrote. “I’m more resolved than ever to continue to stand for every woman’s right to have a voice in protecting themselves, including their safety, their integrity, their dignity and their story.”\n\nMotions to dismiss Baldoni’s claims by Lively, Reynolds and their publicist, Leslie Sloane, were all granted. The judge also granted a motion to dismiss by the New York Times.\n\nBaldoni had sued the publication, who was the first to report on Lively’s allegations of sexual harassment, for $250 million for libel, claiming that the newspaper published an article “rife with inaccuracies, misrepresentations, and omissions” that relied on Lively’s “self-serving narrative.”\n\nThe judge ruled that Baldoni can file an amended complaint on the allegations of tortious interference with contract, relating to Reynolds and Lively, and breach of implied covenant, relating to Lively, by June 23, if they choose to do so.\n\nIn a statement to CNN on Tuesday, Bryan Freedman, an attorney for Baldoni, said they intend to file an amended claim.\n\n“The Court has invited us to amend four out of the seven claims against Ms. Lively, which will showcase additional evidence and refined allegations. This case is about false accusations of sexual harassment and retaliation and a nonexistent smear campaign,” the statement continued. “With the facts on our side, we march forward with the same confidence that we had when Ms. Lively and her cohorts initiated this battle and look forward to her forthcoming deposition.”\n\nIn a statement, New York Times spokesperson Charlie Stadtlander said, “We are grateful to the court for seeing the lawsuit for what it was: a meritless attempt to stifle honest reporting.”\n\n“Our journalists went out and covered carefully and fairly a story of public importance, and the court recognized that the law is designed to protect just that sort of journalism,” the statement added. “We will continue to stand up in court for our journalism and for our journalists when their work comes under attack.”\n\nA months-long legal battle\nThe New York Times was the first to report – in an article titled “‘We Can Bury Anyone’: Inside a Hollywood Smear Machine” – that Lively had filed a complaint with Civil Rights Department about Baldoni’s alleged conduct on set of “It End With Us” and after production. Those complaints are typically confidential.\n\nLively alleged that after being sexually harassed with inappropriate comments and behavior on set, Baldoni’s team then orchestrated a smear campaign against her to ruin her reputation in the public sphere. Lively’s complaint contained hundreds of text messages between Baldoni and his crisis PR team, including one text that read they could “bury” her.\n\nBaldoni’s production company Wayfarer Studios, his business partner Jamey Heath, Wayfarer co-founder Steve Sarowitz, and members from Baldoni’s PR and crisis management team were all cited as plaintiffs on the suit against the Times.\n\nThe judge’s ruling on Monday did not address the merits of Baldoni’s complaint but rather held that Lively’s sexual harassment claims in her complaint were protected by law and could not form the basis of a defamation claim. He cited a piece of California legislation that came in response to the #MeToo movement.\n\nHe also wrote in his decision that the act of providing Lively’s complaint to the New York Times was not sufficient to constitute defamation “because the complaint is protected by the fair report privilege.”\n\nIn the months after Lively and Baldoni’s suits were filed, the legal battle has often played out in the public eye. In February, Baldoni’s team published a website containing texts and an alleged timeline relating to Lively’s claims. The website, a separate leaked voice note that Baldoni sent to Lively and several public statements made by Baldoni’s lawyer were the subject of several court hearings in recent months.\n\n“It Ends With Us” starred Lively and Baldoni as an on-screen couple and featured instances of domestic violence.\n\nRumors of their fractured professional relationship began percolating during the film’s 2024 press tour.\n\nThis story has been updated."
